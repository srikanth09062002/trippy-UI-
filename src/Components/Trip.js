      heading=' Cathedral, in Christian churches'
      text='Cathedral, in Christian churches that have an episcopal form of church government, the church in which a residential bishop has his official seat or throne, the cathedra. Cathedral churches are of different degrees of dignity. There are cathedral churches of simple diocesan bishops, of archbishops or metropolitans, of primates, patriarchs, and, in the Roman Catholic Church, of the pope. A cathedral church is not necessarily large and magnificent, although most cathedrals have become so. Since the territorial organization of the early church followed that of the Roman Empire, cathedrals from the first were established wherever possible in towns, not in villages. In the early European Middle Ages, the town in which a cathedral church was situated became known as the cathedral city.'
